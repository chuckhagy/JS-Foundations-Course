# Week 5: DOM, jQuery, AJAX, and Fetch


There is a lot material covered in this week. We first focused on solidifying our DOM manipulation skills by working on a 
drumkit project. We covered jQuery and its role with JavaScript. We used jQuery and compared certaint methods that made it much
easier/efficient to accomplish some DOM related tasks such as toggling elements to show/hide. 

We also covered the JSON data format, which is just a way we can organize our information that is both readable by 
computers and humans. We discussed what AJAX is and how we can make API requests to get arbitrary data, and then display that data
without causing a whole page refresh. This is how infinite scrolling like feeds on Facebook work. To facilitate the network requests,
we used a native JavaScript method called fetch(). Fetch is a much better utility to use than making network requests with jQuery.
