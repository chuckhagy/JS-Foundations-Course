# Week 4: DOM, CSS, HTML


With CSS, we learned how to apply multiple css properties to elements, how to add pseudo-classes to change styling when state changes,
and how to target elements using css selectors. We revisted html, discussed how different elements can have different attributes,
and how we can give html elements ids and class names. 

We also discussed the DOM, the Document Object Model. The DOM can be represented as hierarchial tree structure. We were introduced
to the document object and how to target, manipulate HTML elements. Lecture slides can be found below:
