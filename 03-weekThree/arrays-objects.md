# Arrays and Objects
## Week of November 13 - November 17th

This week we focused on creating, using, and utilizing native methods of arrays. We also covered the concept of objects, dot vs bracket
notation, and how to iterate through objects as well. Next week we will focus on the Document Object Model and start manipulating html
with JavaScript. Please be sure to run through the exercises for unit 9,10, and 11 as they are valuable to understanding these concepts. 

Unit 9: [Create and access list data in arrays](https://learn.galvanize.com/cohorts/336/units/3960)
